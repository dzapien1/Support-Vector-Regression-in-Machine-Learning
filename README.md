Support Vector Regression in Machine Learning
This project demonstrates a basic implementation of stock price prediction using Support Vector Regression (SVR) in Python. The data is sourced from a CSV file containing historical stock prices.

The objective of this project is to predict future stock prices using machine learning techniques, specifically Support Vector Regression (SVR). We use three different SVR kernels: linear, polynomial, and radial basis function (RBF) to compare their performance in predicting stock prices. The project includes the following steps:
Data Collection: Reading historical stock price data from a CSV file.
Data Preprocessing: Extracting and transforming date and price information.
Model Training: Training SVR models with different kernels on the preprocessed data.
Prediction and Visualization: Predicting future stock prices and visualizing the results.
